# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The simulation analytics page is experiencing a critical runtime error: "Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops." This error prevents users from viewing simulation analytics and charts, making the feature completely unusable.

The issue appears to be caused by infinite re-render loops in the SimulationAnalyticsDashboard component and related filter management components, where useEffect hooks and state updates are triggering cascading re-renders.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Infinite Re-render Loop

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the simulation analytics page without encountering runtime errors, so that I can view and analyze my simulation data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/simular/[id]/analytics` THEN the page SHALL load without throwing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
2. WHEN the SimulationAnalyticsDashboard component mounts THEN it SHALL not trigger infinite re-render loops
3. WHEN filter state changes occur THEN they SHALL not cause cascading state updates that lead to infinite loops
4. WHEN useEffect hooks execute THEN they SHALL have properly defined dependencies that prevent unnecessary re-executions
5. WHEN memoized values are computed THEN they SHALL have stable dependencies that don't change on every render

### Requirement 2: Stabilize Filter State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want filter changes to work smoothly without causing performance issues, so that I can effectively analyze simulation data with different filter combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes estudio selection THEN it SHALL update the filter state without triggering infinite loops
2. WHEN grouper filters are modified THEN the component SHALL re-render only once per change
3. WHEN payment method filters are updated THEN the state management SHALL not cause cascading updates
4. WHEN comparison periods are changed THEN the analytics data SHALL refresh exactly once
5. WHEN filter persistence is enabled THEN saving/loading state SHALL not trigger additional re-renders

### Requirement 3: Optimize Component Re-rendering

**User Story:** As a user, I want the simulation analytics page to perform efficiently, so that I can interact with filters and charts without delays or freezing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component renders THEN expensive computations SHALL be properly memoized
2. WHEN filter state changes THEN only affected components SHALL re-render
3. WHEN analytics data is fetched THEN loading states SHALL be managed without causing render loops
4. WHEN error states occur THEN error handling SHALL not interfere with normal rendering cycles
5. WHEN the component unmounts THEN all pending state updates SHALL be properly cancelled

### Requirement 4: Maintain Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing simulation analytics features to continue working after the fix, so that I don't lose any functionality while gaining stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN all charts and analytics data SHALL display correctly
2. WHEN filters are applied THEN the analytics data SHALL update to reflect the filtered results
3. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the content SHALL load properly without errors
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the export functionality SHALL work as expected
5. WHEN navigating between simulations THEN the analytics SHALL load for each simulation correctly
