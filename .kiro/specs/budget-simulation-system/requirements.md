# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Budget Simulation System allows users to create hypothetical budget scenarios and compare them with historical data through visual analytics. Users can create multiple simulations with custom descriptions, set simulated budgets for all categories, and view comparative charts that show historical data alongside simulated projections. This feature enables users to perform "what-if" analysis on their budgeting decisions and understand potential outcomes before implementing changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a budget planner, I want to create multiple budget simulations with descriptive names, so that I can explore different financial scenarios and keep them organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the "Simular" menu option THEN the system SHALL display a simulation management interface
2. WHEN I click "Create New Simulation" THEN the system SHALL present a form to enter a simulation description
3. WHEN I submit a valid simulation description THEN the system SHALL create a new simulation and add it to my simulation list
4. WHEN I view my simulations list THEN the system SHALL display all my created simulations with their descriptions and creation dates
5. IF I have no simulations THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with instructions to create the first simulation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a budget planner, I want to select an existing simulation and set budgets for all categories with both Efectivo and Credito payment methods, so that I can define comprehensive financial parameters that match real budget structures for my scenario analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a simulation from the list THEN the system SHALL navigate to the simulation budget configuration interface
2. WHEN I access the budget configuration THEN the system SHALL display all available categories with separate input fields for Efectivo and Credito budget amounts
3. WHEN I enter budget amounts for categories THEN the system SHALL validate that amounts are positive numbers for both payment methods
4. WHEN I save the simulation budgets THEN the system SHALL store both Efectivo and Credito budget configurations for each category in the selected simulation
5. WHEN I return to a previously configured simulation THEN the system SHALL display the previously saved budget amounts for both Efectivo and Credito
6. IF a category has no budget set for either payment method THEN the system SHALL treat those values as zero for calculations
7. WHEN I view budget totals THEN the system SHALL display separate totals for Efectivo and Credito as well as combined totals per category

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a budget analyst, I want to view comparative charts showing historical data alongside simulation data, so that I can analyze the potential impact of my simulated budget changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the simulation analytics tab THEN the system SHALL display chart options similar to the dashboard agrupadores
2. WHEN I select chart parameters THEN the system SHALL render charts combining historical estudios/agrupadores data with simulation data
3. WHEN viewing period comparisons THEN the system SHALL treat simulation data as the most recent period for comparison purposes
4. WHEN I change simulation selection THEN the system SHALL update all charts to reflect the new simulation data
5. WHEN historical data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a budget analyst, I want to compare different time periods with my simulation data, so that I can understand trends and make informed decisions about budget adjustments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select period comparison mode THEN the system SHALL display historical periods alongside the simulation as a new period
2. WHEN I view period-over-period analysis THEN the system SHALL calculate percentage changes between historical periods and simulation
3. WHEN I filter by agrupadores THEN the system SHALL apply the same filtering logic to both historical and simulation data
4. WHEN I hover over chart elements THEN the system SHALL display detailed tooltips distinguishing between historical and simulated values
5. WHEN simulation data differs significantly from historical trends THEN the system SHALL highlight these variations visually

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a budget manager, I want to manage my simulations (edit, delete, duplicate), so that I can maintain an organized collection of scenarios and iterate on my analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I right-click or access actions for a simulation THEN the system SHALL provide options to edit, delete, or duplicate
2. WHEN I edit a simulation description THEN the system SHALL update the description while preserving budget data
3. WHEN I delete a simulation THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data after confirmation
4. WHEN I duplicate a simulation THEN the system SHALL create a copy with all budget settings and a modified description
5. WHEN I attempt to delete the currently selected simulation THEN the system SHALL warn me and redirect to another simulation or the main list

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the simulation charts to integrate seamlessly with existing dashboard functionality, so that I can leverage familiar interfaces and maintain consistency in my analysis workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use simulation charts THEN the system SHALL provide the same filtering and grouping options as dashboard agrupadores
2. WHEN I apply payment method filters THEN the system SHALL filter both historical and simulation data consistently
3. WHEN I switch between chart types THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visualization quality and performance as existing charts
4. WHEN I export chart data THEN the system SHALL include both historical and simulation data with clear labeling
5. WHEN I use responsive features THEN the system SHALL adapt simulation charts to different screen sizes like existing dashboard components
