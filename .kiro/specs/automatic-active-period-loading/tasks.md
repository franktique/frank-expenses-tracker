# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create session storage utility for active period management

  - Create utility functions for saving, loading, and clearing active period data from session storage
  - Implement cache validation logic with timestamps and version checking
  - Add error handling for session storage failures and browser compatibility
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Create active period loading service

  - Implement service function to fetch active period from the periods API
  - Add retry logic with exponential backoff for network failures
  - Include error categorization for different failure types (network, no active period, etc.)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Enhance auth context to load active period on login

  - Modify the login function in auth context to trigger active period loading after successful authentication
  - Add state management for active period and loading status in auth context
  - Implement error handling for period loading failures during login
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [x] 4. Integrate session storage with budget context initialization

  - Modify BudgetProvider to check session storage for cached active period on startup
  - Implement logic to use cached data for immediate UI updates while validating against server
  - Add background synchronization to ensure cached data matches server state
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.3, 4.2_

- [x] 5. Implement period change synchronization

  - Update openPeriod function to save new active period to session storage
  - Update closePeriod function to clear active period from session storage
  - Ensure session storage updates happen atomically with server state changes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Add logout cleanup functionality

  - Modify logout function to clear active period from session storage
  - Ensure all period-related state is reset on logout
  - Test cleanup works correctly across different logout scenarios
  - _Requirements: 4.4_

- [x] 7. Implement error handling and user feedback

  - Add error states and messaging for period loading failures
  - Implement fallback behavior when active period loading fails
  - Create user guidance for scenarios where no active period exists
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive error recovery mechanisms

  - Implement retry functionality for failed period loading attempts
  - Add cache invalidation logic for corrupted or outdated session data
  - Create graceful degradation when session storage is unavailable
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_
