# Source Fund Integration Test

## Test Summary

Successfully implemented source fund functionality in the expense form (Task 5).

## Changes Made

### 1. Budget Context Updates

- Updated `addExpense` function signature to include `sourceFundId: string` parameter
- Updated `updateExpense` function signature to include `sourceFundId?: string` parameter
- Updated validation logic to prevent same fund transfers (source === destination)
- Updated API calls to include `source_fund_id` in request body

### 2. Expenses View Component Updates

#### New State Variables

- `newExpenseSourceFund`: Fund | null - for new expense source fund selection
- `editExpenseSourceFund`: Fund | null - for edit expense source fund selection
- Updated `editExpense` state to include `sourceFundId?: string`

#### Form Enhancements

- Added `SourceFundSelector` component to new expense form
- Added `SourceFundSelector` component to edit expense dialog
- Updated form validation to require source fund selection
- Added validation to prevent same source/destination fund selection

#### UI Updates

- Added "Fondo Origen" column to expense table
- Updated table headers and empty state colspan
- Added source fund display with blue styling to distinguish from destination fund (green)
- Updated edit expense button to populate source fund state

#### Validation & Error Handling

- Required source fund validation in both create and edit forms
- Same fund transfer prevention
- Clear error messages for missing source fund

## Requirements Fulfilled

### Task 5.1 - Enhance expense creation form

✅ Add source fund dropdown to new expense form
✅ Implement category change handler to update available source funds (handled by SourceFundSelector)
✅ Add form validation to require source fund selection
✅ Integrate with existing fund filter to provide smart defaults

### Task 5.2 - Enhance expense editing form

✅ Add source fund dropdown to edit expense dialog
✅ Implement logic to show current source fund as selected
✅ Handle source fund updates when category changes during editing (handled by SourceFundSelector)
✅ Add validation to prevent invalid source fund selections

## Testing Notes

- Build completed successfully with no errors
- All TypeScript interfaces and schemas already updated in previous tasks
- SourceFundSelector component provides automatic category-fund relationship validation
- Smart defaults work with current fund filter
- Visual distinction between source (blue) and destination (green) funds

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for user testing. The next tasks in the spec involve:

- Task 6: Update expense display with source fund information (partially done)
- Task 7: Update fund balance calculation logic
- Task 8: Create migration API endpoint
- Task 9: Update budget context with source fund support (done)
- Task 10: Add comprehensive validation and error handling
- Task 11: Create unit tests for source fund functionality
