  console.log("üîß Credit Card Deletion Fix Verification\n");

  console.log("‚úÖ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:");
  console.log(
    "   The API endpoint /api/expenses was not handling the credit_card_id parameter"
  );
  console.log(
    "   When the component called /api/expenses?credit_card_id=<id>, it returned ALL expenses"
  );
  console.log(
    "   This caused the deletion validation to show 944 expenses (total count) instead of the actual count"
  );

  console.log("\n‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:");
  console.log(
    "   Added credit_card_id filter support to the GET /api/expenses endpoint"
  );
  console.log(
    "   The API now properly filters expenses by credit_card_id when the parameter is provided"
  );

  console.log("\nüìã CHANGES MADE:");
  console.log("   1. Modified app/api/expenses/route.ts");
  console.log("   2. Added creditCardFilter parameter extraction");
  console.log("   3. Added conditional SQL query for credit card filtering");
  console.log(
    "   4. Maintained backward compatibility with existing fund_id filtering"
  );

  console.log("\nüîç CODE CHANGES:");
  console.log("   Before:");
  console.log("     const fundFilter = searchParams.get('fund_id');");
  console.log("     // Only handled fund_id parameter");

  console.log("\n   After:");
  console.log("     const fundFilter = searchParams.get('fund_id');");
  console.log(
    "     const creditCardFilter = searchParams.get('credit_card_id');"
  );
  console.log("     ");
  console.log("     if (creditCardFilter) {");
  console.log("       // Filter expenses by credit card");
  console.log("       expenses = await sql`");
  console.log("         SELECT ... FROM expenses e");
  console.log("         WHERE e.credit_card_id = ${creditCardFilter}");
  console.log("       `;");
  console.log("     } else if (fundFilter) {");
  console.log("       // Existing fund filter logic");
  console.log("     }");

  console.log("\nüéØ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW:");
  console.log("   ‚úÖ When deleting a credit card with NO associated expenses:");
  console.log("      - API call: /api/expenses?credit_card_id=<id>");
  console.log("      - Response: [] (empty array)");
  console.log("      - Validation: hasExpenses = false, expenseCount = 0");
  console.log("      - Result: Direct deletion without warning");

  console.log("\n   ‚úÖ When deleting a credit card WITH associated expenses:");
  console.log("      - API call: /api/expenses?credit_card_id=<id>");
  console.log(
    "      - Response: [expense1, expense2, ...] (actual associated expenses)"
  );
  console.log(
    "      - Validation: hasExpenses = true, expenseCount = actual count"
  );
  console.log("      - Result: Warning dialog with correct count");

  console.log("\nüß™ TO TEST THE FIX:");
  console.log("   1. Start the development server: npm run dev");
  console.log("   2. Navigate to /tarjetas-credito");
  console.log(
    "   3. Try to delete a credit card that has NO associated expenses"
  );
  console.log(
    "   4. It should delete directly without showing the 944 expenses warning"
  );
  console.log("   5. Try to delete a credit card that HAS associated expenses");
  console.log("   6. It should show the correct count of associated expenses");

  console.log("\nüìä VERIFICATION STEPS:");
  console.log("   You can also test the API directly:");
  console.log("   1. GET /api/expenses (should return all expenses)");
  console.log("   2. GET /api/credit-cards (should return all credit cards)");
  console.log(
    "   3. GET /api/expenses?credit_card_id=<specific-id> (should return only expenses for that card)"
  );

  console.log("\nüéâ FIX COMPLETE!");
  console.log(
    "   The credit card deletion validation should now work correctly."
  );
  console.log("   No more false warnings about 944 associated expenses!");
};

// Run verification
