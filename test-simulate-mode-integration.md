# Simulate Mode Filter Integration Test

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Estudio Filter Integration

- ✅ Simulate mode should work with Estudio filter selections
- ✅ When Estudio is selected, simulate mode should show budget data filtered by that Estudio
- ✅ Changing Estudio while in simulate mode should update the budget data accordingly
- ✅ Filter state should be maintained when toggling simulate mode on/off

### 2. Agrupador Filter Integration

- ✅ Simulate mode should work with Agrupador filter selections
- ✅ When specific Agrupadores are selected, simulate mode should show budget data only for those Agrupadores
- ✅ Changing Agrupador selection while in simulate mode should update the budget data accordingly
- ✅ Filter state should be maintained when toggling simulate mode on/off

### 3. Payment Method Filter Integration

- ✅ Simulate mode should handle Payment Method filter correctly (budgets are payment-method agnostic)
- ✅ When Payment Method filter is applied, simulate mode should show all budget data (not filtered by payment method)
- ✅ UI should indicate that budgets don't depend on payment method when simulate mode is active
- ✅ Filter state should be maintained when toggling simulate mode on/off

### 4. Combined Filter Integration

- ✅ Simulate mode should work with multiple filters applied simultaneously
- ✅ All filter combinations should work correctly with simulate mode
- ✅ Filter state should be preserved across simulate mode toggles

### 5. Error Handling and Fallbacks

- ✅ Missing budget data should show zero values with appropriate messaging
- ✅ Empty states should provide context-specific messages based on active filters
- ✅ Tooltips should clearly indicate simulation mode and filter context

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced Data Fetching**:

   - Modified query parameters to use "all" for payment method in simulate mode
   - Added simulate mode flag to API calls
   - Maintained Estudio and Agrupador filtering in simulate mode

2. **Improved Filter State Management**:

   - Enhanced `handleSimulateModeToggle` to maintain all filter states
   - Added proper data clearing when toggling simulate mode
   - Preserved filter selections across mode changes

3. **Better User Feedback**:

   - Enhanced empty state messages to explain filter interactions
   - Added visual indicators for active simulate mode
   - Improved tooltips to show filter context in simulation

4. **Payment Method Handling**:
   - Budgets are fetched with "all" payment method in simulate mode
   - Added UI notification about payment method behavior
   - Updated empty states to explain budget/payment method relationship

### Code Changes:

- Enhanced `handleSimulateModeToggle` function
- Modified data fetching logic for grouper and category data
- Updated empty state messages and tooltips
- Added visual indicators for simulate mode status
- Improved error handling for simulate mode with filters

## Verification Steps:

1. **Test Estudio Filter**:

   - Select an Estudio
   - Enable simulate mode
   - Verify budget data is filtered by Estudio
   - Change Estudio while in simulate mode
   - Verify data updates correctly

2. **Test Agrupador Filter**:

   - Select specific Agrupadores
   - Enable simulate mode
   - Verify only selected Agrupadores show budget data
   - Change Agrupador selection while in simulate mode
   - Verify data updates correctly

3. **Test Payment Method Filter**:

   - Select a specific payment method (Cash or Credit)
   - Enable simulate mode
   - Verify all budget data is shown (not filtered by payment method)
   - Check UI notification about payment method behavior

4. **Test Combined Filters**:

   - Apply multiple filters (Estudio + Agrupador + Payment Method)
   - Enable simulate mode
   - Verify correct behavior with all filters
   - Toggle simulate mode on/off
   - Verify all filter states are maintained

5. **Test Error Scenarios**:
   - Test with missing budget data
   - Verify appropriate empty state messages
   - Check tooltip behavior with filtered data

## Expected Results:

- ✅ Simulate mode integrates seamlessly with all existing filters
- ✅ Filter states are preserved when toggling simulate mode
- ✅ Payment method filter behavior is clearly communicated to users
- ✅ Empty states provide helpful context about filter interactions
- ✅ All requirements from task 6 are satisfied
